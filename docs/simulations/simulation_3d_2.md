### 3D Silo Avalanche Analysis with Dimensional Analysis (Pi Theorem)

This LIGGGHTS simulations explores avalanche phenomena in a 3D silo. The focus is on characterizing avalanche behavior and applying the Pi theorem for dimensional analysis. Simulated data is used to find dimensionless parameters that help to scale the avalanche.
