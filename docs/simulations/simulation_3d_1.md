### 3D Silo Discharge Simulation with Particle Mixing and Flow Rate Measurement

This LIGGGHTS simulations study a 3D silo discharge process, focusing on the mixure of granular particles and the measurement of the flow rate. The simulations aim to understand how particle properties influence the discharge dynamics. Data analysis includes flow rate calculations.
